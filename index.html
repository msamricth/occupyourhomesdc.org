On June 6th, the day after the eviction, I found myself bawling outside of National Tire and Battery waiting for repairs to be made on my car. The reality of these kinds of things always takes about a day to sink in.

Homes group will meet at the Archives Metro Station to launch its first major rally and
action, bringing the struggle for housing to the doors of a financial institution that continues
to fail the public it was chartered to serve.
With the help of public money, big banks are again making record profits but continue the
deceitful practices that threw the world into crisis—a phenomenon that has caused ruin here
in the DC Metro area, especially in communities of color. With one in four people behind on
their mortgage, Prince George&#8217;s County suffers one of the worst foreclosure crises in the
United States. More than one in three homes in the county currently face foreclosure.
